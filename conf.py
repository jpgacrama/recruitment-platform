# -- Define here your working directory -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

import os
import sys

# -- Some general info  about the project -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

project = u'Sphinx'

# -- A few basic configurations ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The documentation in this project will be mostly generated from .rst files
# In This project, every auto-documented module/class has its own .rst file, under the main documentation dir,
#   which is rendered into an .html page.
# Get more information here: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html
source_suffix = ['.rst']

# This is the name of the main page of the project.
# It means that you need to have an `index.rst` file where you will design the landing page of your project.
# It will be rendered into an .html page that you can find at: `_build/html/index.html`
# (this is a standard name. change it only if you know what you are doing)
master_doc = 'index'

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This patterns also effect to html_static_path and html_extra_path
exclude_patterns = ['_build']

# List here any paths that contain templates, relative to this directory.
# You can find some not-so-intuitive information here: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/templating.html
# But the best way to learn is by example, right? :)
# So, for example, in this project, I wanted to change the title of the Table Of Contents in the sidebar.
#   So I copied `<Sphinx install dir>/themes/basic/globaltoc.html` into the `_templates` folder,
#      and replaced 'Table of Content' with 'Sphinx'.
templates_path = ['_templates']


# -- Define and configure non-default extensions ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# You can find a list of available extension here: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/extensions.html
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.intersphinx',
    'sphinx.ext.todo',
    'sphinx.ext.mathjax',
    'sphinx.ext.ifconfig',
    'sphinx.ext.graphviz',
    'sphinxcontrib.plantuml',
]

# Above extensions explanation and configurations:

# todo: When you use the syntax ".. todo:: some todo comment" in your docstring,
#         it will appear in a highlighted box in the documentation.
#       In order for this extension to work, make sure you include the following:
todo_include_todos = True

# viewcode: Next to each function/module in the documentation, you will have an internal link to the source code.
#           The source code will have colors defined by the Pygments (syntax highlighting) style.
#           You can checkout the available pygments here: https://help.farbox.com/pygments.html
pygments_style = 'native'

# autodoc: The best thing about Sphinx IMHO is autodoc.
#          It allows Sphinx to automatically generate documentation for the docstrings in your code.
#          Get more info here: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/ext/autodoc.html
# Some useful configurations:
autoclass_content = "both"  # Include both the class's and the init's docstrings.
autodoc_member_order = 'bysource'  # In the documentation, keep the same order of members as in the code.
autodoc_default_flags = ['members']  # Default: include the docstrings of all the class/module members.

# imgmath: Sphinx allows use of LaTeX in the html documentation, but not directly. It is first rendered to an image.
# You can add here whatever preamble you are used to adding to your LaTeX document.
imgmath_latex_preamble = r'''
